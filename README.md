# UTeezer 

## Unofficial responsive Deezer webapp for Ubuntu Touch
**This is a beta. Expect Bugs. Does not work on Pinephone yet**

This is an unofficial Deezer Webapp with focus on usability on Phones.
The Deezer website is by design not ready for usage on smaller devices.
This App injects custom JavaScript/CSS to make the site responsive and usable.

How to set up:
Install the app, login and play music. Congrats you are using UTeezer.
To stop background suspention consider using the UT Tweak Tool App to 
continue listening whilst using other apps. 
Music starts stuttering on my devices if screen is locked unless you are
using bluetooth speakers/headphones.

What works/what doesnt:
